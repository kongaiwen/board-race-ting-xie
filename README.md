## Press Release
## Summary ##
  > Are you ready to test your memory and handwriting skills? With "Board Race! Ting Xie!", now you can practice your skills in Chinese (or any other language). How quickly can you rember how to spell and/or draw new vocabulary words in your target language? Play alone or against friends to find out and challenge yourself to further growth in your target language!

## Problem ##
  > In many languages, the script is completely different from the Latin alphabet many languages use. For those of us learning a new langauge, learning to write in a new script can be just as tricky as recalling the vocabulary word itself.

Ting Xie!" aims to give the user a fun and interactive outlet for practicing both the memory recall and handwriting challenges of learning new foreign language vocabulary. By providing a fun, engaging "gamified" learning platform, you can rest assured that you will improve steadily and have fun at the same time!
